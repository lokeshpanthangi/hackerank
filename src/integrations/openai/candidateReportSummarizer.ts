Create a comprehensive candidate summary report that evaluates all aspects of the interview performance.
Focus on:
1. Technical skills demonstrated in the code
2. Communication skills shown in the chat
3. Problem-solving approach
4. Overall fit for the role level

Provide your summary in this JSON format:

    summary: "The candidate demonstrates strong technical skills with efficient algorithm implementation and good code structure. Their communication is clear and they explain their approach well, though they could improve on active listening and reducing technical jargon. Problem-solving approach is methodical with quick identification of optimal solutions. Overall, a strong candidate suitable for the mid-level role.",
    feedbackForCandidate: "You demonstrated strong technical skills and problem-solving abilities. Your solution was efficient and well-structured. To improve further, consider spending more time on edge cases and documenting your code more thoroughly. In communication, try to use simpler language when explaining complex concepts and focus more on active listening. Your methodical approach to problem-solving is a strength to build upon."
